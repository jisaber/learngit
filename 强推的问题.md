##切记，没事别强制推送 push -f

这样做可能会覆盖在线的仓库原有的内容


开始遇到  
```
$ git push -u origin master
Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '52.74.223.119' to the list of known hosts.
To github.com:jisaber/learngit.git
! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:jisaber/learngit.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```
然后用提示中的这个
```
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.

```
解决了
```
$ git pull origin master
Warning: Permanently added the RSA host key for IP address '13.229.188.59' to the list of known hosts.

```
然后依然push不上去，接着看到了强制push，迫不及待的试了下，然后发现会覆盖我在线仓库的东西，现在正在看怎么找到我之前的内容。。。

```
